# AbarimMUD
C# Diku Based MUD Engine in the very early stage(basically there's no engine yet).

# License
The C# source code of the engine itself uses MIT license. However it uses content(areas, mobiles, etc) from ROM MUD 2.4. That content uses Diku/Merc/ROM licenses. It could be found here: https://github.com/scandum/basedmud/tree/master/doc
